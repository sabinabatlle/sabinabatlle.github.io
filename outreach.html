                <p class="dark">I believe dissemination is the final goal of research, and that as researchers we should give something in return to the society. For this reason, I've always combined my research and scientific communication with teaching and dissemination.</p>
                <h2 class="red thin">History and archaeology</h2>
                <p class="dark">public archaeology, and these lasts years, sharing the advances of the yearly campaigns with the people from the area by giving a <a href="https://femterreta.cat/activitats/castellet/vilavella-del-castellet-jornada-de-portes-obertes-2022/" target="_blank">guided tour to present the new findings</a>.
                <p class="dark">I have also visited some primary schools to explain how archaeologists work to children aged 7-11. Always glad to contribute in creating future low-income, exploited professionals!</p>
                <h2 class="red thin">Digital Humanities</h2>
                <p class="dark">These last years I have also teached seminars about Databases for archaeologists to the students of the Bachelor in Archaeology (Universitat de Barcelona) and a two-session workshop on Python to the students of the Master in Digital Humanities (Universitat de Barcelona).</p>
