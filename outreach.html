                <p class="dark">I believe dissemination is the final goal of research, and that as researchers we should give something in return to the society. For this reason, I've always combined my research and scientific communication with teaching and dissemination.</p>

                <p class="dark">The excavation of Vilavella del Castellet started as a public archaeology project; promoted and supported by a local cultural organization, between 2015 and 2017 the site was excavated with the help of local volunteers under the coordination of some archaeologists. Now, the study of the site falls within Muntanya Viva project, but we have maintained the bonds with the local association. From time to time, we participate in the cultural activities and meetings, and we open the site to everybody sharing the advances of the yearly campaigns with the people from the area by giving a <a href="https://femterreta.cat/activitats/castellet/vilavella-del-castellet-jornada-de-portes-obertes-2022/" target="_blank" class="orange thick">guided tour to present the new findings</a>.</p>
                <p class="dark">I have also visited some primary schools to explain how archaeologists work to children aged 7-11. Always glad to contribute in creating future low-income, exploited professionals!</p>
                <p class="dark">I have published some dissemination papers on the History online magazine <a href="https://aboriginemag.com/author/sabinabatllebaro/" taget="_blank" class="orange thick">Ab Origine</a>, mostly about historical gastronomy.</p>

                <p class="dark">These last years I have also teached seminars about Databases design to the students of the Bachelor in Archaeology (Universitat de Barcelona) and a two-session workshop on Python to the students of the Master in Digital Humanities (Universitat de Barcelona).</p>
