      <div class="content">
        <p class="dark">The benefits of data opening for both science and society have been widely exposed. Data sharing not only helps making research more sustainable but also accelerates innovation, and Archaeology is not an exception. In fact, the openness of Archaeology in general and of archaeological research data has been seen not only as a beneficial practice but necessary, as a practically imperative solution to the already destructive nature of the archaeological research method, as well as an ethical obligation for a discipline that studies a public good such as heritage and uses mostly public funding.</p>
        <p class="dark">In the road leading to open archaeological research data, researchers play a crucial role, as they are the ones who collect, work, and manage the data during most of their lifecycle. Considering this, it feels necessary to assess their points of view, to fully understand how they are managing and sharing (or not) their data, and why. Understanding the researchers’ perceptions and their current research data management practices can allow us not only to get to know the real starting point and evaluate the implementation of open data, but also to define the challenges this new model must overcome and develop a better strategy to foster its implementation.</p>
        <p class="dark">My study focuses Catalan archaeology researchers, as this region has a dynamic and complex yet well-defined archaeological community that includes more than seven research institutions and nearly 30 research groups. With the goal to get to know these researchers’ practices and perspectives, I am conducting a series of interviews to 40 of the principal investigators of archaeological research projects. During the interviews, topics such as data management practices, data sharing practices, reuse practices as well as opinions around archaeological open data, its possibilities and challenges, are discussed. In this poster, I will be presenting the theoretical background of the study, the methodology applied, the design of the questionnaire, and an overview of the preliminary results gathered up to the moment.</p>

        <p class="dark">The main goals of this research were:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><p class="dark">Assess the current practices of data management, sharing and reuse within the archaeological research projects in Catalonia</p></li>
          <li><p class="dark">Analyse the rationale behind these practices</p></li>

      <button type="button" class="collapsible orange">Background</button>
      <div class="content">
        <p class="dark">Several researchers have discussed about data sharing in Archaeology fromdifferent points of view [14] [54]. The growing interest on this topic is demon-strated by the rising number of publications on open data, such as the issueof Open Archeology in the journal World Archaeology [42], the forum on thistopic in the first issue of the Journal of Eastern Mediterranean Archaeology& Heritage Studies [34] and the book dedicated to open source archaeology[17]. Also, the growing number of communications on this topic in the variousarchaeological conferences1highlights this trend [14].</p>
        <p class="dark">Open data in Archaeology has been one of the main topics of interest forresearchers in this discipline advocating for open science [2] [14]. Most publica-tions on open data and open archeology in general focus on the transformationsthat these new models and practices will bring about in the discipline, for betteror worse. In this regard, the reflections of Jeremy Huggett and Andrew Bevan,who have been skeptical about the increasing volume of freely accessible data,should be highlighted. Both researchers call for caution and professionalism inthe face of the new situation, which can lead to many problems [7], in order toensure the quality of the results of archaeological research.</p>
        <p class="dark">However, the majority of researchers emphasize the possibilities that opendata can provide to the discipline [33] [14] [47]. In some cases, the openness of Archaeology and in particular of research data is seen not only as a beneficialpractice but necessary for the advancement of the discipline, practically a sinequa non condition to be able to respond to the big questions that Archaeologyhas not yet been able to solve [41]. In this sense, data sharing is seen, in somecases, as a practically imperative solution to the already destructive nature ofthe archaeological research method [34] [54].</p>
        <p class="dark">In their chapter included in the book Open Source Archeology [17], Mooreand Richards [54] break down the potential benefits of open data for archaeo-logical research:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><p class="dark">Greater participation and democratization of archeology, whichwould increase the commitment between society or the community, con-sidered the public of Archaeology [14] [18]. In short, a more open Archaeology would bring archaeological information and knowledge cloto society, it would allow the creation of a network or community with in-ternal interactions [42] [54], and it would become a more inclusive science[5] [47]. This argument is largely linked to a socio-economic reason, con-sidered one of the main justifications for defending open data in general.In publicly funded projects, very numerous in the case of Archaeology,opening the data to return to society of the investment made is presentedpractically as a moral obligation [14] [47] [2]</p></li>
          <li><p class="dark">Better preservation of archaeological data, which, due to the al-ready mentioned destructive nature of the research method, becomes akey point in the work of researchers as stewards of the common culturaland historical heritage [54]. Digital data require maintenance in order tobe preserved; if shared in well-prepared repositories, the chances of thembeing preserved are much higher [33]</p></li>
          <li><p class="dark">Improved archaeological research, as open data implies an increasein collaboration between members of the scientific community [4] [35].It is also seen to open up the possibilities of reaching more people andfostering multidisciplinarity [5], generating dialogue and rising new ques-tions, hypotheses and interpretations of the past [54]. At the same time,data openness increases transparency [5] and is a first step towards repli-cability of results, necessary to evaluate hypotheses and explore new pos-sibilities [4] [54] [47] [29]. In this sense, the potential of data integrationshould also be highlighted, for which it is essential to have accessibleand well-documented datasets [5] [33]. All of this certainly contributesto an improvement of science in every way, and a greater appreciation ofresearch [4] [5] [54]</p></li>
          <li><p class="dark">Increased sustainability of archaeological research, which has sofar focused on funding excavation campaigns to generate new data. Al-though the process of preparing the data for later reuse is also a task thatrequires an investment of time and money, it does not involve mobilizingsuch a large number of economic and human resources [29] [70]</p></li>
          <li><p class="dark">Greater impact on politicsor the cultural world beyond research [5][19].</p></li>
        </ul>

      <div class="content">
        <p class="dark thick">Data collection</p> 
        <p class="dark">We conducted online semi-structured qualitative interviews. The interviews were recorded, and their average length was around 1 hour.</p>
        <p class="dark">The questionnaire used to guide the interviews covered 3 topics:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><p class="dark">Data creation and management habits within the project</p></li>
          <li><p class="dark">Data sharing habits and perspectives of the researcher</p></li>
          <li><p class="dark">Data reuse habits and perspectives of the researcher</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="dark thick">Data analysis</p>
        <p class="dark">The interviews were transcribed, and they are currently being coded and thematically analysed using qualitative content analysis, with both deductive and inductive codes.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="dark thick">Limitations</p>
        <p class="dark">The population chosen to study is quite homogeneous. For future research, we would widen the population to include younger researchers, who might have different experience on dealing with research data and different perspectives. As prospective PI’s, their opinions could be key when planning future strategies to promote open data in archaeological research.</p>
        <p class="dark">Professional archaeologists would also be considered, as most of the archaeological interventions are commercial.</p>
