        <div class="content">
          <p class="dark">The benefits of data opening for both science and society have been widely exposed. Data sharing not only helps making research more sustainable but also accelerates innovation, and Archaeology is not an exception. In fact, the openness of Archaeology in general and of archaeological research data has been seen not only as a beneficial practice but necessary, as a practically imperative solution to the already destructive nature of the archaeological research method, as well as an ethical obligation for a discipline that studies a public good such as heritage and uses mostly public funding.</p>
          <p class="dark">In the road leading to open archaeological research data, researchers play a crucial role, as they are the ones who collect, work, and manage the data during most of their lifecycle. Considering this, it feels necessary to assess their points of view, to fully understand how they are managing and sharing (or not) their data, and why. Understanding the researchers’ perceptions and their current research data management practices can allow us not only to get to know the real starting point and evaluate the implementation of open data, but also to define the challenges this new model must overcome and develop a better strategy to foster its implementation.</p>
          <p class="dark">My study focuses Catalan archaeology researchers, as this region has a dynamic and complex yet well-defined archaeological community that includes more than seven research institutions and nearly 30 research groups. With the goal to get to know these researchers’ practices and perspectives, I am conducting a series of interviews to 40 of the principal investigators of archaeological research projects. During the interviews, topics such as data management practices, data sharing practices, reuse practices as well as opinions around archaeological open data, its possibilities and challenges, are discussed. In this poster, I will be presenting the theoretical background of the study, the methodology applied, the design of the questionnaire, and an overview of the preliminary results gathered up to the moment.</p>

        <button type="button" class="collapsible orange">Background</button>
        <div class="content">
          <p class="dark">Since 2012, archaeological open data has been an increasingly discussed topic. Most of the literature revolves around defining the main advantages and disadvantages of this model, which act as accelerators and barriers for its implementation.</p>
          <p class="dark">In 2010, Costello listed the benefits of opening research data, many of which have been repetedly defended and expanded by other researchers:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p class="dark">Added value to research</p></li>
            <li><p class="dark">Possibility to validate results</p></li>
            <li><p class="dark">Prevention of scientifici misconduct and methodological fraud</p></li>
            <li><p class="dark">Help to policy making</p></li>
            <li><p class="dark">More sustainable research</p></li>
            <li><p class="dark">Return of public investment made in research</p></li>
            <li><p class="dark">Return of data to its original place/community</p></li>
          </ul>
          <p class="dark">Most of these reasons to open research data are also valid for Archaeology, and authors agree that the discipline would benefit from a greater openness. To these already indentified pros to Open Research data, some more especific have been added (Moore & Richards, 2015) such as the increase of collaboration, the democratization of Archaeology, and the amelioration of the preservation of archaeological data.</p>
          <p class="dark">However, there are also perceived disadvantages that act as barriers for the implementation of this model. In a systematic review of the open data literature, Chawinga (2019) identified the main barriers to data sharing:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p class="dark">Lack of incentives/recognition for researchers</p></li>
            <li><p class="dark">Potential danger for sensitive data</p></li>
            <li><p class="dark">Lack of time</p></li>
            <li><p class="dark">Fear of losing rights over the data</p></li>
            <li><p class="dark">Fear of misuse or misinterpretation of the data</p></li>
            <li><p class="dark">Fear of losing the scoop</p></li>
          </ul>
          <!--<p class="dark">To analyse these accelerators and barriers of open research data, multiple studies have been carried on, mostly assessing the practices and perceptions of the researchers on open data by completing surveys. Many surveys have as a focus a country or area, and analise the habits and perspectives of researchers from different fields of science, the last one being the survey on data management and openness conducted by the European Commission within the project «European Research Data Landscape». Some others are discipline-centered, and </p>
          <p class="dark">Few studies of this kind have been focused to the archaeological research community. In _____, within the project ARIADNE, a community ____ survey was conducted to X. The way of recruiting participants, most of them were likely to be related to the project and therefore more familiar with open data and open science, make their results probably too optimistic.</p>

        <button type="button" class="collapsible orange">Methodology</button>
        <div class="content">
          <p class="dark thick">Data collection</p> 
          <p class="dark">We conducted online semi-structured qualitative interviews. The interviews were recorded, and their average length was around 1 hour.</p>
          <p class="dark">The questionnaire used to guide the interviews covered 3 topics:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p class="dark">Data creation and management habits within the project</p></li>
            <li><p class="dark">Data sharing habits and perspectives of the researcher</p></li>
            <li><p class="dark">Data reuse habits and perspectives of the researcher</p></li>
          </ul>
          <p class="dark thick">Data analysis</p>
          <p class="dark">The interviews were transcribed, and they are currently being coded and thematically analysed using qualitative content analysis, with both deductive and inductive codes.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p class="dark thick">Limitations</p>
          <p class="dark">The population chosen to study is quite homogeneous. For future research, we would widen the population to include younger researchers, who might have different experience on dealing with research data and different perspectives. As prospective PI’s, their opinions could be key when planning future strategies to promote open data in archaeological research.</p>
          <p class="dark">Professional archaeologists would also be considered, as most of the archaeological interventions are commercial.</p>
